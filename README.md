Image Processing with Python:

Task 1: Real-Time Tracking of a Blue Marker 
• Write a Python script that accesses the webcam. 
• The script should detect a blue marker moving in front of the webcam. 
• As the marker moves, the script should track its path and display a real-time trail in 
blue on the video feed. 
Task 2: License Plate Capture from a Video 
• Write a Python script that takes a video containing multiple cars as input. 
• (You can create this video by combining multiple images into a 4MP resolution 
video.) 
• While the video is playing, if the user presses the "S" key, the script should: 
Check if a license plate is visible in the current video frame. 
If a plate is detected, extract the license plate image and save it as a .jpg 
file on the computer.
